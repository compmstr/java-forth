xt -> pointer to a Runnable
ForthWord is runnable, native code is just a regular Runnable


Need to figure out a way to do jumps...
Branch works on offsets...
  Do branch based on values, the ForthRunnable to jump to

Have entire dictionary as an array of ForthExecutables.
	That way the return stack can just be ints, and you can do relative addressing
	Normally, a literal is just pushed onto the stack, and LIT/LITERAL reads item following it, and skips it on
		instruction pointer...
	I could:
		- Store the number inside the LIT word, execute pushes number onto stack
		- Have a subclass for literals that LIT looks for, and returns a number
